      left by our early ancestors. However, we can also make inferences about human
      origins by studying our closest living relatives: chimpanzees, the great apes
      of West and Central Africa. Because humans and chimps are so closely related,
      patterns in chimpanzee behavior may tell us quite a bit about how the earliest
      hominids lived and evolved.",

      prominent, we can get a better idea of the evolutionary scenarios that
